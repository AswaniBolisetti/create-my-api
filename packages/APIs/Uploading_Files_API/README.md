This requires minimal setup and configuration.Note that the tinyURL part requires your application to be deployed whose url shall be RUNTIME env variable,however for localhost development you can the use the RUNTIME as localhost:3000 or any suitable port but you would need to follow the instructions present in the Upload method of the UploadController class.You can also use docker to run this application by first building the image through the docker build . -t "your_image_name" and then docker run -p 3000:3000 -t "your_image_name".

Also you can import the postman collection present in the tests folder and test the endpoints.
